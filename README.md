🐍 Method 3: Run Locally Using Python (No VS Code Needed)

If you have Python installed on your computer, you can run the site locally by following these steps:
	1.	Download the ZIP of the project from GitHub:
	•	Click the green “Code” button in the repository
	•	Select “Download ZIP”
	2.	Unzip the folder to a location on your computer (e.g., Desktop)
	3.	Open a terminal or command prompt in the unzipped folder:
	•	On Windows: Hold Shift and right-click inside the folder → select “Open PowerShell window here” or “Open Command Prompt here”
	•	On Mac/Linux: Open Terminal and navigate to the folder using cd
	4.	Run this command to start a local server:
